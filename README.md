# Advance-SQL

"Advanced SQL" typically refers to a set of more complex and sophisticated SQL queries and techniques that go beyond the basics of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

Some advanced SQL concepts and techniques:
(1) Subqueries
(2) Joins
(3) Window Functions
(4) Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
(5) Stored Procedures and Functions
(6) Indexes and Optimization
(7) Triggers
(8) Advanced Aggregation (Beyond basic aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT), advanced SQL may involve using GROUP BY with HAVING clauses, and handling NULL values in aggregates)
